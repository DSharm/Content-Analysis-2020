They all involve systematic reading or observation of texts or artifacts which are assigned labels (sometimes called codes) to indicate the presence of interesting, meaningful pieces of content.[2][3] By systematically labeling the content of a set of texts, researchers can analyse patterns of content quantitatively using statistical methods, or use qualitative methods to analyse meanings of content within texts.\n",

Simple computational techniques can provide descriptive data such as word frequencies and document lengths. Machine learning classifiers can greatly increase the number of texts that can be labeled, but the scientific utility of doing so is a matter of debate. Further, numerous computer-aided text analysis (CATA) computer programs are available that analyze text for pre-determined linguistic, semantic, and psychological characteristics.[4]\n",

      "1.\n",
      "with a high degree of ethics, professionalism, and respect for the public. \n",
      "2.\n",
      "in a manner that promotes trust between the Department and the communities that it serves. \n",
      "C.\n",
      "Core Principle. The Chicago Police Department seeks to gain the voluntary compliance of subjects, when consistent with personal safety, to eliminate the need to use force or reduce the force that is needed.\n",
      "D.\n",
      "Assessing Uses of Force. The Chicago Police Department recognizes that Department members are often forced to make split-second decisions—in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving—about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation. \n",
      "1.\n",
      "These decisions must therefore be judged based on the totality of the circumstances known by the member at the time and from the perspective of a reasonable Department member on the scene, in the same or similar circumstances, and not with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight. \n",
      "2.\n",
      "Department members involved in a use of force incident will make an independent assessment and decision to use force based on the totality of the circumstances and will be individually responsible for articulating the specific details that justify their use of force.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "Nothing in this policy requires members to take actions, or fail to take actions, that unreasonably endanger themselves or others.\n",
      "4.\n",
      "Nothing in this policy precludes the legally mandated oversight or assessment of a Department member's use of force consistent with the procedures established in this policy.\n",
      "E.\n",
      "Whenever a use of force incident result in a potentially life-threatening injury or death, Department members will refer to the Department directive titled \"Firearm Discharge and Officer-Involved Death Incident Response and Investigation\" for additional notifications, response procedures and investigative responsibilities.\n",
      "III.\n",
      "Use of Force - When Authorized\n",
      "A.\n",
      "Definition of Force.  Force is defined as any physical contact by a Department member, either directly or through the use of equipment, to compel a subject’s compliance.\n",
      "B.\n",
      "Use of Force: Objectively Reasonable, Necessary, and Proportional. Department members may only use force that is objectively reasonable, necessary, and proportional, under the totality of the circumstances, in order to ensure the safety of a member or third person, stop an attack, make an arrest, control a subject, or prevent escape.\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Objectively reasonable. The main issue in evaluating every use of force is whether the amount of force used by the member was objectively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances faced by the member on the scene. Reasonableness is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application.  Factors to be considered by the member include but are not limited to:\n",
      "a.\n",
      "whether the subject is posing an imminent threat to the member or others.\n",
      "b.\n",
      "the risk of harm, level of threat or resistance presented by the subject.\n",
      "c.\n",
      "the subject’s proximity or access to weapons.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "Necessary. Department members will use only the amount of force required under the circumstances to serve a lawful purpose.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "Proportional. Department members will use only the force that is proportional to the threat, actions, and level of resistance offered by a subject. This may include using greater force or a different type of force than that used by the subject. The greater the threat and the more likely that the threat will result in death or serious physical injury, the greater the level of force that may be necessary to overcome it. When or if the subject offers less resistance, however, the member will decrease the amount or type of force accordingly.\n",
      "4.\n",
      "De-escalation. Members will use de-escalation techniques to prevent or reduce the need for force when it is safe and feasible to do so based on the totality of the circumstances. This includes continually assessing the situation and modifying the use of force as circumstances change and in ways that are consistent with officer safety, including stopping the use of force when it is no longer necessary. Examples of de-escalation techniques include but are not limited to:\n",
      "a.\n",
      "providing a warning and exercising persuasion and advice prior to the use of force.\n",
      "b.\n",
      "determining whether the member may be able to stabilize the situation through the use of time, distance, or positioning to isolate and contain a subject.\n",
      "c.\n",
      "requesting additional personnel to respond or make use of specialized units or equipment including crisis-intervention-team trained officers, as necessary and appropriate.\n",
      "5.\n",
      "Prohibitions.\n",
      "a.\n",
      "The use of excessive force, unwarranted physical force, or unlawful force by a Department member is prohibited and will not be tolerated.\n",

      "c.\n",
      "Force used as punishment or retaliation (e.g., force used to punish or retaliate for fleeing, resisting arrest, or insulting a Department member) is prohibited.\n",
      "d.\n",
      "Force used in response to a person’s lawful exercise of First Amendment rights (e.g., protected speech, lawful demonstrations, observing or filming police activity, or criticizing a Department member or conduct) is prohibited.\n",

      "Use of Deadly Force: Necessary to Prevent Death or Great Bodily Harm. The following additional policies apply to the use of deadly force:\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Definition of Deadly Force. Deadly force is force by any means that is likely to cause death or great bodily harm. It includes but is not limited to:\n",

      "d.\n",
      "application of a chokehold (applying direct pressure to a person’s trachea (windpipe) or airway (front of the neck) with the intention of reducing the intake of air), carotid artery restraints (techniques that compresses the blood vessels in the neck to inhibit or restrict blood flow to carotid arteries), or other maneuvers for applying direct pressure on a windpipe or airway.  \n",
      "2.\n",
      "Definition of Imminent Threat.  A threat is imminent when it is objectively reasonable to believe that:\n",
      "a.\n",
      "the subject's actions are immediately likely to cause death or great bodily harm to the member or others unless action is taken; and\n",
      "b.\n",

      "c.\n",
      "the subject has the opportunity and ability to cause death or great bodily harm.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "Last Resort.  The use of deadly force is a last resort that is permissible only when necessary to protect against an imminent threat to life or to prevent great bodily harm to the member or another person.   Consistent with this requirement, a sworn Department member may use deadly force only when such force is necessary to prevent:\n",
      "a.\n",
      "death or great bodily harm from an imminent threat posed to the sworn member or to another person.\n",
      "b.\n",

      "b.\n",
      "against a person who is a threat only to himself, herself, or property.\n",
      "5.\n",

      "A.\n",
      "Once the scene is safe and as soon as practical, whenever an individual is injured, complains of injury, or requests medical attention, Department members:\n",
